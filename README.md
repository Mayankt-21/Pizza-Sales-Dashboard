1.Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard 
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze pizza sales performance across categories, sizes, and time periods — helping identify key revenue drivers, top-selling pizzas, and customer purchasing patterns.

2. Short Description / Purpose
The Pizza Sales Dashboard provides a data-driven overview of a pizza chain’s sales operations over one year. It enables decision-makers to monitor business performance metrics like total revenue, total orders, and average order value, while uncovering insights into peak sales days, top-performing categories, and best-selling pizzas.

3. Business Problem
The pizza chain lacked a centralized analytics system to:
Understand which pizza categories and sizes contributed most to sales.
Identify top and bottom-performing pizzas by revenue and quantity.
Analyze customer buying patterns across different days and months.
Optimize inventory, marketing campaigns, and menu pricing strategies.

The dashboard was built to solve these challenges by consolidating data into an intuitive, visual reporting system.

4. Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
Power BI Desktop – For data visualization and report creation.
Power Query – Used for data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Applied for calculated measures (e.g., Total Revenue, Avg Order Value).
Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (Orders, Pizzas, Categories, Sizes) for cross-filtering and aggregation.
File Format – .pbix for report development and .png for dashboard previews.
